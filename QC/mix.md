## System Design, OS, and DSA Mixed Questions

1. Write runtime polymorphism without using `virtual`.
2. What is `vtable` and `vptr`?
3. Can a destructor be virtual?
4. Can a constructor be virtual?
5. What is Singleton pattern? Write its implementation.
6. Solve the Rain Water Trapping problem.
7. Schedule meetings based on in-time and out-time intervals.
8. Implement an LRU Cache.
9. Given an array of `n+2` elements where `n` elements are distinct and 2 are repeated, find the two repeated numbers.
10. Explain the concept of Concurrency.
11. What is an Atomic number in context of programming?
12. What is a Critical Section?
13. Write a code to protect a critical section **without** using mutex or semaphore.
14. Define and implement your own custom Mutex.
15. Difference between Mutex and Semaphore.
16. What is Virtual Memory?
17. What is DMA (Direct Memory Access) and how is it implemented?
18. Difference between User Space and Kernel Space. How do they interact?
19. What is Shared Memory and how is it implemented?
20. How does the Kernel share commands with user applications?
21. Explain IPC (Inter-Process Communication).
22. Design 3 APIs: `create`, `use`, and `destroy`.  
    - No inputs or outputs  
    - Only used to allocate memory in RAM and then destroy it  
    - Memory should be created and destroyed only once
23. Given `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are single-digit non-negative numbers, find values such that:  
    `XYZ + XYZ + XYZ = ZZZ`
24. Some questions were asked related to internal memory management (not remembered exactly).
25. Explain System Calls and how they work.
